# LLaKata

LLamaKata is a chatbot for shopwise. It uses LLama 3.2 by huggingface.

Using Pandas as a DataFrame to get infomation from the CSV, merge before hand.

We uses Streamlit for the chatbot to place our chatbot to the webside 
# https://llakata-aikata2024.streamlit.app/

We use various keywords to have the chatbot seek different item such as phone, tvs.

#What and Why

We choose LLama as a open source API as my team agreed that the chatbot is still a new to the shop. 
It is unwise to use a close source API for the shop because the customers might not even like the chatbot to begin with.
Moreover customers details are privacy, it is safer to use a open source over a close source.
